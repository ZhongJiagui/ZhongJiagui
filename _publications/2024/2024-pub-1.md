  In everyday life, frequently used objects like a cup often have unffxed positions and multiple instances within the same category, and their carriers frequently change as well. As a result, it becomes challenging for a robot to efffciently navigate to speciffc instances. To tackle this challenge, the robot must capture and update scene changes and plans continuously. However, current object navigation approaches focus mainly on semantic-level tasks and lack dynamic scene memory updates. This paper captures the relationships between frequently used objects and their static carriers. It constructs an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and updates the carrying status during robot navigation to reffect dynamic changes in frequently used objects. Based on the CRSG, we further propose an instance navigation method that models the navigation process as a Markov Decision Process. At each step, decisions are informed by LLM commonsense knowledge and VLM feature similarity. We designed a series of long-sequence navigation tasks for frequently used everyday items in the Habitat simulator. The results demonstrate that by updating the CRSG, the robot can efffciently locate moved targets. Additionally, we deployed our algorithm on an actual robot and validated its practical effectiveness.
