  In order to enhance the manipulation capabilities of quadruped robots, numerous research have explored the integration of manipulators onto these robots. However, most manipulators encounter difficulties in harmonizing with quadruped robots, resulting in compromised locomotion performance. This paper addresses the challenge of stable locomotion and manipulation for quadruped robots equipped with manipulators. Firstly, a lightweight manipulator designed specifically for quadruped robots is introduced, featuring a generous working space and the capability to perform tasks such as torsion. Secondly, a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body control which mainly includes whole-body dynamics and trajectory tracking is proposed to enhance the stability of the quadruped robot in complex environments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through physical prototype experiments.
