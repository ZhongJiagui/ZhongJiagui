I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Automation (English-taught) program at the Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests include **embodied AI**, **robotics**, **unmanned systems**, **control**, and **navigation**. Currently, I am working on my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of **Prof. Xinbin** from the School of Automation.

I have also been fortunate to receive guidance from **Prof. Meng Fei** (School of Mechatronics) and **Prof. Yue Yufeng** (School of Automation) at BIT, whose support has significantly shaped my academic growth.

📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2024) | 🔗 Code (Coming Soon) | 🌐 Project  

> In this paper, we propose an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and an instance navigation method to improve object navigation in dynamic environments. Our approach enables robots to update scene changes and locate moved targets efficiently. The proposed methodology has been validated both in simulation and on physical robots.
