I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Automation (English-taught) program at the Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests include **embodied AI**, **robotics**, **unmanned systems**, **control**, and **navigation**. Currently, I am working on my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of **Prof. Xinbin** from the School of Automation.

I have also been fortunate to receive guidance from **Prof. Meng Fei** (School of Mechatronics) and **Prof. Yue Yufeng** (School of Automation) at BIT, whose support has significantly shaped my academic growth.
